School project for Web Programming Class that got canceled
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

This is a project that got canceled for a web programming class. Since I had already started it and enjoyed using node.js I decided to complete it and post it on Git Hub.

As you will probably notice Front-End is not my forte, and on the backend there are blatant security concerns (passwords and usernames kept in plain text (not hashed), etc.). I simply decided to follow exactly the instructions given for the canceled project, since my goal was just to get comfortable with node.js. Also, I did not extensively test the website, but the node.js part should work.

Finally, I assume there are better ways to send and modify HTML through node.js than what I did, but my research on the internet for this topic somehow did not give me many interesting results.
